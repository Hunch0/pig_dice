# Pig Dice
#### A dice game for two players, 5th March 2019.
#### By Philip Kairu Njoroge
## Description
The game takes in input of a player in form of a die roll and increments the score to a hundred to determine the winner among the two.
## BDD
This shows how Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) works.
The logic is divided into two sections: the business logic and the user interface, each evaluates different functions to calculate the total outcomes of two players.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Internet access.
* Internet-accessible device.
* Basic knowledge of the internet.
## Technologies Used
The game uses basic HTML and CSS, with JavaScript handling the logic in the background. Bootstrap styling also helps to improve the aesthetics.
## Live demo
A demonstration of how the site works can be found at: https://hunch0.github.io/pig_dice/

## Roadmap
In the future the code may be modified to cater for more players and also accommodate a one player mode for competing with the computer at different levels.
